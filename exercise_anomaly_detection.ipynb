        "# Exercise: Anomaly detection\n",
        "\n",
        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "Looking for anomalies in data is an ubiquitous task that occurs in many fields of research. However, the exact meaning of anomaly detection can vary: In modern machine learning literature, the phrase is often associated with **outlier detection**, i.e. identifying datapoints with extreme values in one or more features that are considered out-of-distribution. Since such datapoints are usually rare, they are also often referred to as **point anomalies**.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Particle Physics, we are often interested in a different task: We are looking for a signal resonance that is buried under an overwhelmingly large background. Phrased differently, we are looking for a local accumulation of datapoints inside another distribution. This is referred to as **overdensity** or **group anomaly**, since usually multiple signal datapoints exist that form a coherent group inside the background distribution. \n",

        "## Supervised vs. Unsupervised methods\n",
        "\n",
        "There are two major ways how to approach anomaly detection problems:\n",
        "1. **Supervised** anomaly detection: Simulate the signal and background processes and train a classifier on the simulated samples to distinguish them. Then apply the trained classifier on measured data.\n",
        "2. **Unsupervised** anomaly detection: Detect anomalies without using the truth-level information from signal and background labels. Again we can distinguish methods that use simple out-of-distribution scores to detect anomalous events and methods that are suited for group anomaly detection.\n",
        "\n",
        "Supervised and Unsupervised methods have different advantages and disadvantages. Of course, the major advantage of a fully supervised search is that it offers the best signal sensitivity. However, the sensitivity is only with respect to the particular signal model and cannot be extended to other signals or phase spaces easily. Also, there is a heavy dependence on the correct simulation of the background, which can often be challenging - for example when considering QCD processes. Thus, covering all phase space regions and all possible signal models is unfeasible in terms of person and computational power.\n",
        "\n",
        "The disadvantage of unsupervised methods is clearly that the signal sensitivity might not be optimal. However, they can be used in a completely **data-driven** way, without the need of complex Monte Carlo simulations. Also, it is possible to detect anomalies in a **model-agnostic** way, i.e. without looking for a *specific* signal model and to extend the search across many regions of phase space.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Unsupervised out-of-distribution detection\n",
        "\n",
        "These methods learn a \"concept of normality\" from the training data and then the anomaly score reflects how much other events deviate from this concept. For example, a model could be trained to learn the background e.g. from a \"sideband\" region of the phase space, where no signal events are expected and then for a signal-enriched sample from a \"signal region\" compute the deviation from the background as an anomaly score. An example for such a model is an **Autoencoder** which you will learn about in this exercise.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Unsupervised group anomaly detection\n",
        "\n",
        "Identifying group anomalies is much more difficult than identifying point anomalies, in particular if their contribution to the overall data distribution is as small as in a Particle Physics case. The most powerful test to distinguish signal and background is - according to the [Neyman-Pearson lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neyman%E2%80%93Pearson_lemma) - based on the **likelihood ratio** of signal and background:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$R(\\boldsymbol{x})=\\frac{p_{\\mathrm{sig}}(\\boldsymbol{x})}{p_{\\mathrm{bg}}(\\boldsymbol{x})}$$\n",
        "\n",
        "The major challenge in anomaly detection is to find an estimate of the very small signal contribution $p_{\\mathrm{sig}}(\\boldsymbol{x})$. At the same time, we also need a reliable and precise method to estimate our background density, $p_{\\mathrm{bg}}(\\boldsymbol{x})$.\n",
        "\n",
        "As already mentioned, it is usually impossible to directly estimate $p_{\\mathrm{sig}}(\\boldsymbol{x})$ in a practical Particle Physics search. Instead, one can estimate the density of the combined signal and background densities (i.e. $p_{\\mathrm{sig+bg}}(\\boldsymbol{x})$) from a \"signal region\", where we expect most of the signal to be located, and the background-only density from a \"sideband\" where no signal is expected. Then again one uses the likelihood ratio of these densities ($R_{\\mathrm{uns}}(\\boldsymbol{x})$) to distinguish signal and background. If we assume $p_{\\mathrm{sig+bg}}(\\boldsymbol{x})=p_{\\mathrm{sig}}(\\boldsymbol{x})+p_{\\mathrm{bg}}(\\boldsymbol{x})$, the resulting likelihood ratio $R_{\\mathrm{uns}}(\\boldsymbol{x})$ should show the same behavior as the original $R(\\boldsymbol{x})$ (i.e. it takes high values for signal-like events and low values for background-like events).\n",

        "## Exercise 1: Weakly supervised methods\n",
        "\n",
        "Methods using weak supervision are supervised trainings on labels that are \"noisy\": The labels we train our models on do not contain the full signal/background information, but make use of a \"proxy\" classification task, that yields a similar result.\n",
        "\n",
        "As mentioned above, we divide our phase space into two regions: A \"signal region\", where we expect the majority of signal to reside and the \"sidebands\" which contain almost no signal. We then assign labels to the events based on which of the regions they are located in: Events in the signal region are assigned the \"positive\" label and events in the sidebands are assigned the \"negative\" label. Finally, we train a classifier (e.g. a deep neural network) to distinguish these two.\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Essentially, we are distinguishing two samples containing different **signal fractions**: While the signal region sample should contain a relatively high amount of signal samples, we expect only very few signal events in the sideband sample. Since the majority of events in both samples is still background, this method of assigning labels is \"noisy\", as a significant proportion of the training will consist of distinguishing background events from other background events.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, this method can be used in a completely **data-driven** way, as no prior knowledge about the true labels is necessary. Therefore, this method is also referred to as **Classification without Labels (CWoLa)** [https://doi.org/10.1007/JHEP10%282017%29174 ]. In the paper introducing CWoLa, it has been shown that the optimal classifier distinguishing signal vs. background is the same as the optimal classifier distinguishing between signal region vs. sideband events under the condition of a higher signal fraction in the signal region sample. This means under ideal conditions, we should be able to detect signal events in an unsupervised, model-independent way.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, the CWoLa approach also has limitations: it only works for input features that don't have strong correlations with the invariant mass in which the signal that we look for is resonant and the input feature distributions need to be similar between the signal region and the sidebands.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this exercise, you will train a CWoLa model for distinguishing signal and background in a completely unsupervised way."

For simplicity, we set the SR now around where the signal acutally lies (in a realistic scenario, we would scan it over different positions). The SB should be chosen in a way to have similar substructure distributions as the SR, while keeping as many training events as possible.

These are deep learning models that consist of three parts: An **encoder**, a **decoder** and a **bottleneck**. The encoder takes the input data and transforms it into a lower-dimensional representation, also referred to as the **latent space**, which also serves as the above mentioned bottleneck. The decoder then takes the information from the latent space and transforms it back into the original input dimension. This model is then trained such that the (mean squared) difference between input and output is minimized.\n",

A such trained Autoencoder will yield a low loss (i.e. mean squared difference between input and output) for background events, as it has been trained to do so. However, as soon as we present the model with a different event such as an anomalous signal, the Autoencoder does not know how to compress and decompress the input correctly any more, which will yield a high loss value. Thus, one can use the loss value to distinguish signal from background.\n",
        "\n",
        "Similar to weak classification, this can be done in a **completely data-driven way**: For example, we can again divide our phase space into signal region and sidebands to obtain a high purity background sample, train an Autoencoder on events from the sidebands and evaluate on the signal region. Another option would be to train on the whole phase space, since Autoencoders have shown to be very robust against small contaminations of signal, which is usually the case in modern Particle Physics problems.\n",
